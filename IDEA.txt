Though it's not widely known, you can write native-feeling iOS apps.
In this article, I'll explain how to:

    strip away the browser chrome (the url bar and button bar);
    prevent viewport scrolling and scaling;
    respond to multi-touch and gesture events;
    use webkit CSS to get the iPhone OS look and feel;
    cache the app so it runs without internet access;
    get a custom icon on the home screen; and
    have a splash screen load at the start.
